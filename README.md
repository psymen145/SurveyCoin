Mission: Incentivize people to answer surveys. Pay people to answer surveys in native coins. Get surveyors to enter surveys into our platform by issuing new tokens for the each new survey...

How to prevent surveyors from issuing manipulating the market
------------------------------------------------------------
Free 5 surveys for each address
After 5 surveys, surveyors must pay X surveycoin to burn function

How to prevent new addresses from being mass created
-----------------------------------------------------
Interact with HNS registry to determine if the address is associated with a correct institution

How to incentivize surveyees to answer surveys
----------------------------------------------
Get surveycoin depending on survey. If new survey from new address ( < 5 surveys ), get less coins. If > 5 surveys, more surveycoins can be earned.

How are surveycoins minted
--------------------------
Creating new surveys create new surveycoins. To prevent inflationary value... after 5 surveys, the coin surveyors actually have to burn coins ( similar to a paid service). 

There will also be an initial mint of 1,000,000 surveycoins.
Half of those will be given to airdropped to early adopters. Half will be spent for development.
